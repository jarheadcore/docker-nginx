# IWF Nginx Docker Base Image


## Overview

This is a Docker base image for an Nginx webserver communicating with a PHP-FPM server running in a separate
container.

It's a vital part of the IWF application stack.

This image contains configurations for Symfony3, Symfony4 and CraftCMS.

It should be used together with our [PHP base image](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/iwfwebsolutions/phpfpm). 

See our [Symfony Vagrant Docker Example Project](https://github.com/iwf-web/symfony-vagrant-docker-example) for a usage example.


## Links

The image is built weekly based on the official image `nginx:1.14-alpine`.

It's available here: https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/iwfwebsolutions/nginx

You should always use the tag: `iwfwebsolutions/nginx:1.14-latest`


## Versions

The X part of the version number `1.14-X` is always increased when we update the image configuration (e.g. config files).

It is NOT an indication to the patch level of the base image. It's **always** the **latest** nginx image of the supplied version, 
currently only `1.14`.

See the CHANGELOG to find out the details.


## Changes to the official base image

Change     | Description
-----------|--------------
assets     | all the files in the `build/assets` folder are copied to the base image root
framework specific config files  |  The config files in the folder `build/assets/data/conf/nginx/framework-configs` are linked into the folder `/data/conf/nginx/sites.d` on startup through the script `00_link_config_files.sh`
timezone   | The timezone in the Linux environment is changed to the `TIMEZONE` environment variable (default: Europe/Zurich)
document root | The document root specified in the `DOCUMENT_ROOT` environment variable is pre-created
entrypoint  | This is the script that runs when the image is started: `/usr/local/bin/webstartup.sh` - this starts all scripts in `dockerinit.d` folder
command    | This starts the webserver: `nginx -g "daemon off;" -c "/data/conf/nginx/nginx.conf"`


 
## Usage / Environment variables

At the moment this image can be configured with all the configurations in the folder: `build/assets/data/conf/nginx/framework-configs`

The configuration can be chosen with the environment variable `APP_FRAMEWORK`. 

Currently you have 3 options:

Environment variable  | default value  | Description
----------------------|----------------|---------------
APP_FRAMEWORK         | symfony        | The configuration file to link:<br>`symfony` for Symfony 3 (app.php in `web`).<br>`symfony4` for Symfony 4 (index.php in `public`).<br>`craftcms` for CraftCMS 3/4,
RUNTIME_ENVIRONMENT   | local          | Needed for scripts, currently only for `30_adjust_robots-txt.sh` (see below). Options:<br>`local`, `dev`, `qa`, `prod`
DOCUMENT_ROOT         | /app/web       | Directory where the webserver expects your static files to be mounted or copied into
WAIT_FOR              | fpm:9000       | The webserver waits for the FPM container to be started and answer network calls on Port 9000. Disable with an empty string.


## Default startup scripts

All the scripts in the container's `/data/dockerinit.d` folder are run on each startup:

Script       |     Description
-------------|--------------------
00_link_config_files.sh   |  Links the `APP_FRAMEWORK`.conf file from `nginx/framework-configs` to `nginx/sites.d` where it's picked up by the default `nginx.conf`
00_wait-for-deps.sh   | Waits for the `WAIT_FOR` server -- by default for the PHP FPM server
30_adjust_robots-txt.sh  | Creates a "Disallow all" robots.txt file for all environments (defined by `RUNTIME_ENVIRONMENT`) NOT being `local` and `prod`. This prevents search engines to index your DEV/QA sites.


## Extension points (change or extend configuration)

You can insert your own configuration at these points. Just mount your own config files into these directories or create a derived image from this one and change the files as needed.

Folder      | Description
------------|-------------
/data/conf/nginx/http-partials.d   | `.conf` files here are included by the framework configs at the http (global) level
/data/conf/nginx/server-partials.d  | `.conf` files here are included by the framework configs at the server level


## Framework specific

### Symfony 3

### Symfony 4

### CraftCMS

The config file (`docker/build/assets/data/conf/nginx/framework-configs/craftcms.conf`) creates a hard disk cache for Craft pages
in the folder `/var/run/nginx-cache`.
